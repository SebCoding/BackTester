# Back Testing Trading Strategies
Python code that pulls data from ByBit and automates the back testing of a MACD based trading strategy.

Takes as input an Excel file with the matrix of parameters for each test case and produces as ouput an Excel file for each test case with all the market data, indicators and trades. For each batch of tests, the application produces a statistics file with the results to help analyse the performance of the strategy with selected parameters.
